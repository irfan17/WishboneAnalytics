          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Safely Creating Healthy Opening Options Locally Act or the SCHOOL Act</b></p> <p>This bill establishes a grant program and other resources to assist local educational agencies (LEAs) with reopening schools after closures related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).</p> <p>Specifically, the Department of Education (ED) must partner with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to LEAs for certain activities to reopen schools. These activities include (1) purchasing personal protective equipment; (2) cleaning and disinfecting schools; (3) purchasing the supplies necessary to carry out their reopening plans; and (4) complying with the guidelines, recommendations, and other public health communications issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other entities to mitigate the hazards of COVID-19.</p> <p>Additionally, ED and HHS must (1) develop a process to connect health care professionals with schools to assist them with symptom checks and additional supports, and (2) develop recommendations to expand telehealth services to students and teachers in areas with a shortage of health care professionals.</p> <p>Further, HHS must issue guidance to clarify that private health insurance must cover COVID-19 testing, without imposing cost-sharing, through telehealth services in school-based settings. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must issue a letter to advise states on providing coverage for telehealth services in school-based settings under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p> <p>Finally, ED must develop an online clearinghouse to collect and maintain evidence-based information, including best practices, related to reopening schools after closures due to COVID-19.</p>]]></text>
